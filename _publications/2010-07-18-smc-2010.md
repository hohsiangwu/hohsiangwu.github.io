title: "Audio-based music visualization for music structure analysis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-07-18-smc-2010
excerpt: 'We propose an approach to audio-based data-driven music visualization and an experimental design to study if the music visualization can aid listeners in identifying the structure of music. A three stage system is presented including feature extraction, the generation of a recurrence plot and the creation of an arc diagram to visualize the repetitions within a piece. Then subjects are asked to categorize simple forms of classical music with and without audio and visual cues provided. The accuracy and speed are measured. The results show that the visualization can reinforce the identification of musical forms.'
