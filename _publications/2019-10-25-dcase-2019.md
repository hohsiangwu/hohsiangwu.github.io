excerpt: 'SONYC Urban Sound Tagging (SONYC-UST) is a dataset for the development and evaluation of machine listening systems for real-world urban noise monitoring. It consists of 3068 audio recordings from the &quot;Sounds of New York City&quot; (SONYC) acoustic sensor network. Via the Zooniverse citizen science platform, volunteers tagged the presence of 23 fine-grained classes that were chosen in consultation with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. These 23 fine-grained classes can be grouped into eight coarse-grained classes. In this work, we describe the collection of this dataset, metrics used to evaluate tagging systems, and the results of a simple baseline model.'
